# stg1

[Stacked Git](https://github.com/stacked-git/stgit), **StGit** for short, is an
application for managing Git commits as a stack of patches.

`stg1` is a fork of StGit version 1.5, i.e. before StGit was rewritten in Rust.

With a *patch stack* workflow, multiple patches can be developed
concurrently and efficiently, with each patch focused on a single
concern, resulting in both a clean Git commit history and improved
productivity.

For a complete introduction to StGit, see the [Stacked Git
homepage](https://stacked-git.github.io).
