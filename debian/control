Package: stg1
Architecture: all
Depends: git, ${misc:Depends}, ${python3:Depends}
Description: manage stacks of patches in a git repository
 stgit provides similar functionality to quilt
 (i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of git.
 .
 These operations are performed using git commands and the patches
 are stored as git commit objects, allowing easy merging of the stgit
 patches into other repositories using standard git functionality.

Package: stg1-contrib
Architecture: all
Depends: colordiff, stgit, ${misc:Depends}, ${python3:Depends}
Description: set of contributed script to help working with stgit
 Among others, this package provides the following helper scripts:
  * stg-gitk: show all patches in gitk, not only applied ones, and hide logs
  * stg-whatchanged: examine changes that would modify the current patch
  * stg-fold-files-from: pick specific hunks from another patch up the stack
  * stg-dispatch: dispatch specific hunks into another patch down the stack
  * stg-swallow: completely merge another patch into the current one
  * stg-k: provide robust --keep functionality to all stgit commands
 .
 Most of the functionality of these scripts may one day be incorporated into
 stgit.
